*So many games to play...*

I've just finished Ron Chernow's behemoth biography on Alexander Hamilton, a thoroughly amazing if not totally exhausting experience. I'm an avid reader of biographies, from Steve Jobs to Elon Musk to Oppenheimer to Howard Hughes, and this is the most well-researched, comprehensive, and gripping narratives I've read to date. Chernow is able to weave expansive narratives from across the Revolution, from Hamilton to Washington to Jefferson to Adams (Burr, in my opinion, being one of the least interesting characters of the Hamilton saga). My only gripe with the book is the rights were sold for a play--albeit a *very* good play. Hamilton's story deserved a Ridley Scott-esque historical thriller to give us the definitive film on the American Revolution and the design of our nation. 

But the main reason of this post isn't to sing Chernow (or Hamilton's) praises, but moreso to examine the principles behind the accumulation of power and influence that Hamilton garnered despite his rather horrific, violent beginnings over the course of his relatively short life time of 49 years.
