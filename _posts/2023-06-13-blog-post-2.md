*So many games to play...*

In celebration of my move to King's College (Loyalists like myself still call it King's, while traitors to the Crown call it Columbia), I've just finished Ron Chernow's behemoth biography on Alexander Hamilton, a thoroughly amazing if not demanding experience. I'm an avid reader of biographies, from Steve Jobs to Elon Musk to Oppenheimer to Howard Hughes, and this is one of the most well-researched, comprehensive, and gripping narratives I've read to date. Chernow is able to weave an expansive array of personal and political histories across the Revolution, from Hamilton to Washington to Jefferson to Adams to Burr (Burr, in my opinion, being one of the least interesting characters of the Hamilton saga). My only gripe with the book is that the rights were sold for a play. Albeit a *very* good play, Hamilton's story deserved a Ridley Scott-esque historical epic to give us the definitive film on the American Revolution and the design of our nation. 

But the main reason of this post isn't to sing Chernow's (or Hamilton's) praises, but moreso to examine the principles behind the accumulation of power and influence that Hamilton garnered despite his rather horrific, violent beginnings over the course of his relatively short life of 49 years. I wouldn't hesitate to call the present age a soft revolution, not in the sense that power is shifting around much (it seems to be more concentrated than ever), but given that we are designing an entirely new Digital Society,

The 18th century is a Goldilocks zone of history to examine the actions *and* the thoughts of a man, not too far gone to accurately examine (or even find) documentation and eyewitness accounts, but just far enough in the past that communication was still restricted to letters. Just as interesting as Chernow's biography is Joanne Freeman's collection of the works of Hamilton, a book I was able to find due to a rather serendipitous visit to Yorktown and Williamsburg over Memorial Day Weekend. Hamilton was a prolific writer, often drowning his opponents with books of information (there are 27 volumes of Hamilton literature in Columbia's collection, and who knows what else was lost to time...), but we also see his intimate letters to friends, children, or his wife. 

The benefit of time also aids our ability to comb the naked ambition of Hamilton. Jobs and Musk, for example, got to tell their stories while still alive, and thus I've always been a bit suspicious of their accounts. Every man has an incentive to paint his successes as his own, to make the ascent that much steeper and more treacherous. This isn't so much a deceitful or conniving trait as it is the basic human tendency to wrap a clean narrative over what is often a weird, somewhat random collection of events that we call our personal history.
