*All social, economic, and political heirarchies are games. Which lever do we pull?*

In celebration of my move to King's College (Loyalists like myself still call it King's, while traitors to the Crown call it Columbia), I've just finished Ron Chernow's behemoth biography on Alexander Hamilton, a thoroughly amazing if not demanding experience. I'm an avid reader of biographies, from Steve Jobs to Elon Musk to Oppenheimer to Howard Hughes, and this is one of the most well-researched, comprehensive, and gripping narratives I've read to date. Chernow is able to weave an expansive array of personal and political histories across the Revolution, from Hamilton to Washington to Jefferson to Adams to Burr. 

My only gripe with the book is that the rights were sold for a play that tells the story from Burr's perspective (Burr, in my opinion, being one of the least interesting characters of the Hamilton saga). Albeit a *very* good play, Hamilton's story deserved a Ridley Scott-esque historical epic to give us the definitive film on the American Revolution. There are so many amusing Hamilton anecdotes that paint a very charming, folk-hero picture of the man that I would've loved to see on-screen: a young Hamilton dragging artillery from The Battery as the British pound southern Manhattan with cannons, or waking (and thus saving) his Tory headmaster at King's as a patriotic mob descends upon the campus in the middle of the night; the veteran politician Hamilton, while quashing the Whiskey Rebellion, catching and scolding a sleeping sentry, wrathfully relieving the guard of his post and taking his place, marching around camp all night with a musket on his shoulder. 

But the main reason of this post isn't to sing Chernow's or Hamilton's praises, but moreso to examine the principles behind the accumulation of power and influence that Hamilton garnered despite his grim origins and relatively short lifespan of 49 years. I wouldn't hesitate to call the present age a soft pre-revolution, not in the sense that power is shifting around much (it seems to be more concentrated than ever), but given that we are designing an entirely new Digital Society, there is *potential* for some radical, new vision to win out. I won't speculate on what that vision is, or if anything will even change. Still, anyone that wishes to engage in those debates needs a seat at the table, and gaining that seat is precisely what I'm concerned with here. Hamilton, obviously, was a masterclass in this acquisition.

The 18th and 19th centuries are a Goldilocks zone of history to examine the actions *and* the thoughts of a man, not too far gone to accurately examine (or even find) ample documentation and reliable eyewitness accounts, but just far enough in the past that communication was still restricted to letters. Just as interesting as Chernow's biography is Joanne Freeman's collection of the works of Hamilton, a book I was able to find due to a rather serendipitous visit to Yorktown and Williamsburg over Memorial Day Weekend. Hamilton was a prolific writer, often drowning his opponents with words: there are 27 volumes of Hamilton literature in Columbia's collection, and who knows what else was lost to time. Though his public articles (*The Federalist Papers*, etc.) are numerous and well-studied, Freeman's book also compiles intimate letters to friends and family, revealing a complete portrait of this brilliant, volatile, principled Revolutionary. 

The benefit of time also aids our ability to study the acquisition of power, or how one moves up in a position to enact their desires. Jobs and Musk, for example, got to tell their stories while still alive, which gives us reason to be skeptical of their ongoing stories though they are (obviously) much closer to the Digital Society than Hamilton was. Every man has an incentive to paint his successes as his own, to make the ascent that much steeper and more treacherous. This isn't so much a deceitful or conniving trait as it is the basic human tendency to wrap a clean narrative over what is often a weird, somewhat random collection of events that we call our personal history. 

Whether it's Jobs, Musk, or Hamilton, however, the players of the games don't seem to change much. At the two extremes of the spectrum, I posit that there are two fundamental roles: **arbitrageurs** and **builders**. Though I believe that all players have a "fundamental baseline" that they will always eventually snap back to based on nebulous personality traits, people can certainly oscillate between arbitraging and building roles given that power itself is a fluctuating quantity, or be slight superpositions of the two states. People may even have sympathies for one type of role, but act almost entirely in the opposite without even realizing as such. I would argue that Steve Jobs was an example of this contradiction, a man who saw his role as that of a scrappy builder but who more often thrived and innovated in the Old Money worlds of marketing, media, and managerial design. 

Given that there always exists a tension between the present and the future, the main point of distinction between the two roles is that of the empircial reality of power versus the theoretical notion of it. Arbitrageurs, often prototypical insiders, refine and exploit inefficiences of the present system for gains in power, while builders, often prototypical outsiders, cast their hopes in new institutions that may or may not usurp the old guard. I also tend to believe that the population distribution of arbitrageurs and builders are highly, highly skewed towards arbitrageurs once we surpass some basic level of competency or ability, in part due to the high death rate of new institutions. And, as I will further argue with Hamilton, I believe that although being a builder sounds much better, it is not a priori an advantage or a morally superior state in the struggle towards influence even though it often seems praised as such. Lastly, along this vein, as I hinted at using the word "innovated" while calling Jobs an arbitrageur, I do not see either of these roles as synonymous with value-creation or historical importance: the most reductive example of these two roles would be to contrast a boring, Patagonia-clad Stanford MBA at some Palo Alto VC fund and the wiry, self-taught hacker or researcher. Although much of modern media has dedicated substantial attention toward the glorification of the latter, these "literal builders" are just as often arbitrageurs, deriving their influence from large, prestigious institutions and patrician heritage. One should not conflate the verb "to build" with being a builder, but rather to ask what exactly one is *building*. 

Social strata are becoming increasingly liquid, but many of the Founders were arbitrageurs at heart, as are most of the famous figures throughout all of human history. Though it seems contradictory to call revolutionaries "systems insiders," revolutions themselves are like an ironworks forge: in the heat of the chaos, everything appears to be liquid and ill-formed, though the underlying chemical makeup is invariant. Again, we must ask what is *being built*: a nation, of course, but with what remaining institutions? Washington, for example, is one of hundreds of revered historical leaders whose reputation was forged primarily on the battlefield. Jefferson, despite his republican, austere outer shell, was firmly entrenched in the economic and social structure of the colonial South. Each man occupied opposite ends of the political spectrum, but within the limits of each individual's hierarchy, each man was firmly entrenched: Washington with the decorum and stateliness of a dignified solider, Jefferson with the rambunctiousness and vision of a loose confederation of states (or essentially nation-states).
