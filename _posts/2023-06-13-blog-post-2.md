*All social, economic, and political heirarchies are games. Which lever do we pull?*

In celebration of my move to King's College (Loyalists like myself still call it King's, while traitors to the Crown call it Columbia), I've just finished Ron Chernow's behemoth biography on Alexander Hamilton, a thoroughly amazing if not demanding experience. I'm an avid reader of biographies, from Steve Jobs to Elon Musk to Oppenheimer to Howard Hughes, and this is one of the most well-researched, comprehensive, and gripping narratives I've read to date. Chernow is able to weave an expansive array of personal and political histories across the Revolution, from Hamilton to Washington to Jefferson to Adams to Burr. 

My only gripe with the book is that the rights were sold for a play that tells the story from Burr's perspective (Burr, in my opinion, being one of the least interesting characters of the Hamilton saga). Albeit a *very* good play, Hamilton's story deserved a Ridley Scott-esque historical epic to give us the definitive film on the American Revolution. There are so many amusing Hamilton anecdotes that paint a very charming, folk-hero picture of the man that I would've loved to see on-screen: a young Hamilton dragging artillery from The Battery as the British pound southern Manhattan with cannons, or sending his Tory headmaster at King's out of the back of the school as a patriotic mob descends upon the school; the veteran politician Hamilton, while quashing the Whiskey Rebellion, catching and scolding a sleeping sentry, wrathfully relieving the guard of his post and taking his place, marching around camp all night with a musket on his shoulder. 

But the main reason of this post isn't to sing Chernow's (or Hamilton's) praises, but moreso to examine the principles behind the accumulation of power and influence that Hamilton garnered despite his grim origins and relatively short lifespan of 49 years. I wouldn't hesitate to call the present age a soft pre-revolution, not in the sense that power is shifting around much (it seems to be more concentrated than ever), but given that we are designing an entirely new Digital Society, there is *potential* for some radical, new vision to win out. I won't speculate on what that vision is, or if anything will even change. Still, anyone that wishes to engage in those debates needs a seat at the table, and that is precisely what I'm concerned with here. 

The 18th and 19th centuries are a Goldilocks zone of history to examine the actions *and* the thoughts of a man, not too far gone to accurately examine (or even find) ample documentation and reliable eyewitness accounts, but just far enough in the past that communication was still restricted to letters. Just as interesting as Chernow's biography is Joanne Freeman's collection of the works of Hamilton, a book I was able to find due to a rather serendipitous visit to Yorktown and Williamsburg over Memorial Day Weekend. Hamilton was a prolific writer, often drowning his opponents with words: there are 27 volumes of Hamilton literature in Columbia's collection, and who knows what else was lost to time. Though his public articles (*The Federalist Papers*) are numerous and well-studied, Freeman's book also synthesizes intimate letters to friends and family, revealing a complete portrait of this brilliant, volatile, principled Revolutionary. 

The benefit of time also aids our ability to accurately comb the naked ambition of Hamilton. Jobs and Musk, for example, got to tell their stories while still alive, which gives us reason to be skeptical of their ongoing stories though they are (obviously) much closer to the Digital Society than Hamilton was. Every man has an incentive to paint his successes as his own, to make the ascent that much steeper and more treacherous. This isn't so much a deceitful or conniving trait as it is the basic human tendency to wrap a clean narrative over what is often a weird, somewhat random collection of events that we call our personal history.
