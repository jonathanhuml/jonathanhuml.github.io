In the [Harvard](https://www.jonhuml.com/posts/2023/06/harvard/) essay I promised to upload the personal principles I developed over the course of 2022. 

The initial list in January makes up the second half of the document, while the August update (which has more commentary) is the first half.

You can find it [here](https://www.jonhuml.com/files/principles_draft.pdf). 

I'll re-do this sometime soon as this was a huge help for me, and to spare you the necessity of reading the entire 11-page document, I'll list a few of 
my favorites below. 

They're nothing groundbreaking: that's the point!
