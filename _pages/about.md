The name's Huml. Jon Huml. I'm from Durham, North Carolina--a land of highways, suburbs, and fried chicken. I completed my studies in Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-CH, and was affiliated with the [Grant](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/egrant/) lab at NCSU for the last year a half of my studies, working on autonomous wheelchairs. 

I am currently a master's student at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, advised by [Demba Ba](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/demba-ba) within the [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/). My work focuses on algorithm unrolling for dictionary learning problems, with applications in neuroscience. I maintain a strong academic interest in computational decision-making and vision tasks from a neural perspective. One thread of this work that particularly excites me is the interpretability aspect: the weights of an unrolled network, unlike those of a typical neural network, have a one-to-one correspondence with the dictionary atoms and encodings. On the decision-making side, I also work with [Weiwei Pan](https://onefishy.github.io/) and [Finale Doshi_Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) on off-policy evaluation tasks for reinforcement learning. 

I've greatly enjoyed my time here in Boston and at the university. As I seem to have caught the research bug, I will be applying to PhD programs in the fall of 2022.
