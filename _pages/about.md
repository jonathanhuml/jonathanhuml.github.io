Thanks for visiting my personal site. 

Whatever government watch list you've now been added to by our association, I promise it's worth it. 

Fair warning: this is built in batches over the course of several months and may be outdated. 

Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I completed my studies in Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-Chapel Hill. I was affiliated with the [Grant](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/egrant/) electrical engineering lab at NCSU for the last year and a half of my studies, working on autonomous wheelchairs. I've been working to understand and contribute to the field of artificial intelligence since 2017, but math lies at the heart of everything I do. My go-to pick up line is "Hey girl, let's go compute some Christoffel symbols. No, I'm not asking you to--hey, where are you going?"

I then moved to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, advised by [Demba Ba](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/demba-ba) within the [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/). My research in Allston ~~sits~~ sat at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence--namely, how we can inform computer vision tasks with inspiration from the primary visual cortex. Of course, we do this with deep learning (who isn't?). See my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for more details. 

*UPDATE (6/23):* I moved to Columbia's Statistics department to work on my PhD. I have added reflections on my time at Harvard in the essays section. Thanks to all of the folks who made my time in Boston possible, especially: my mom and dad, as well as my grandpa Wile; IACS peers and friends, especially Bill Zhai, Emilia Mazzolenis, and Albert Ge; members of the CRISP lab and Shubham Choudhary, who will soon be kicked out for his heinous criminal activity; the OG DURM Squad including Fat Kat Richard, "De Nang" Dale David Stewart, and Jimbo Jambs; Matt Damon for calling me "Tiny Tim" at the Good Will Hunting Bench; the amazing Maria Stavros Shevory for being the best physical therapist on the planet. 

Personal
=========

I enjoy much more than just math or AI or programming. I especially enjoy writing. In the darker days of the pandemic when I had no sanity, I spent much of my time on a typewriter. Essays, poems, screenplays, whatever--experimenting with form is itself one of the joys of writing. Life is about balance, and mathematical thinking would be weak without clear writing skills (and vice versa). Personally, I think I'm pretty clever because of my undeservedly big ego, but you can judge for yourself in the essays section. Some of them aren't even essays or stories, but easily digestible posts for you to get to know me better. 

Feel free to read them. Or don't. And please feel free to reach out. I'm very easy to spot.
