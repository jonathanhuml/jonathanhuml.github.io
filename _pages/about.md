Thanks for visiting my personal site. 

Whatever government watch list you've now been added to by our association, I promise it's worth it. 

Fair warning: this is built in batches over the course of several months and may be outdated. 

Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I completed my studies in Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-Chapel Hill. I was affiliated with the [Grant](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/egrant/) electrical engineering lab at NCSU for the last year and a half of my studies, working on computer vision. 

I've been working in the field of AI ever since, especially after the recruiters said it would make me money.

I then moved to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, advised by [Demba Ba](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/demba-ba) within the [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/). 

My research in Allston ~~sits~~ sat at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence--namely, how we can inform computer vision tasks with inspiration from the primary visual cortex. See my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for more details. 

*UPDATE (6/23):* I moved to Columbia's Statistics department to work on my PhD. I have added reflections on my time at Harvard in the essays section. Thanks to all of the folks who made my time in Boston possible, especially: my mom and dad, as well as my grandpa Wile; IACS peers and friends, especially [Bill Zhai](https://billyzz.github.io/), Emilia Mazzolenis, and [Albert Ge](https://www.albertge.com/); members of the CRISP lab and Shubham Choudhary, who will soon be kicked out for his heinous criminal activity; the OG DURM Squad including Fat Kat Richard, "Da Nang" Dale David, and Jimbo Jambs; Matt Damon for calling me "Tiny Tim" at the Good Will Hunting Bench; the amazing Maria Stavros Shevory for being the best physical therapist on the planet. 

*UPDATE (9/23):* I have actually deferred my enrollment at Columbia until next Fall. However, I will be continuing research with [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) in the meantime. Please continue to reach out for collaborations, academic or non-academic, until I come back to New York next summer!


Personal
=========

I enjoy thinking about the future of science, especially within the field of neuroAI, the craft and practice of writing as a means of persuasion and thinking, watching and analyzing movies, city planning and architecture, as well as reading good old-fashioned paper books. 

Some of the books that have shaped my psyche include:  Nietzsche's *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, Ron Chernow's *Alexander Hamilton*, Joyce's *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*, or any of the works of Albert Camus or Jung. I'm a sucker for biographies and collecting math textbooks. Gil Strang's linear algebra text and Abbott's analysis textbooks made me want to be a mathematician. 

Some of my favorite movies include: *Blade Runner 2049*, *The Graduate*, *WALL-E*, *The Lighthouse*, *8 1/2*, *The Last Picture Show*, *The Social Network*, and the greatest film of all time is obviously *Casablanca* (I know it's a cliche, but the classics don't change).

I am a former member of the fictitious "Brother Reverend Huml's Traveling Computer Science-Vaudeville Queens," a joint collaborative venture with the Institute for Advanced Study and my business associates [Sticky Ricky](https://www.erickrehbiel.com/) and [Dunkin' Dale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-d-stewart)
