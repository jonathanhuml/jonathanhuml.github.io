Thanks for visiting my site.

Fair warning: this is built in batches over the course of several months and may be outdated. 

Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I completed my studies in Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-Chapel Hill. I was affiliated with the [Grant](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/egrant/) lab at NCSU for the last year and a half of my studies, working on autonomous wheelchairs. I've been working to understand and contribute to the field of artificial intelligence since 2017, but math lies at the heart of everything I do. Its study changes the way you think about the world (I suppose everything does, but math does so in a clearer way). 

I then moved to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, advised by [Demba Ba](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/demba-ba) within the [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/). My research in Allston sits at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence--namely, how we can inform computer vision tasks with inspiration from the primary visual cortex. Of course, we do this with deep learning (who isn't doing deep learning nowadays?). See my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for more details. 

*UPDATE*
I am now at Columbia's Statistics department working on my PhD as of summer 2023. So long, Harvard, and thanks for all the fish! I have added reflections on my time in the essays section. Hit me up if you live in Manhattan--but don't if you live in Queens. 

I enjoy much more than just math or AI or programming. Above all else, I enjoy writing. Essays, poems, screenplays, whatever--experimenting with form is itself one of the joys of writing. Life is about balance, and mathematical thinking would be weak without clear writing skills (and vice versa). There are several forms of truth (literary truth, scientific truth, visual truth, etc.), and of these formats, the screenplay most amazes me in its ability to incorporate all of these different mediums into one product. 

Feel free to read my essays. Or don't. And please feel free to reach out.
