Thanks for visiting my site.

Fair warning: this is built in batches over the course of several months and may be outdated. 

Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I completed my studies in Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-Chapel Hill. I was affiliated with the [Grant](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/egrant/) lab at NCSU for the last year and a half of my studies, working on autonomous wheelchairs. I've been working to understand and contribute to the field of artificial intelligence since 2017, but math lies at the heart of everything I do. My go-to pick up line is "Hey girl, let's go compute some Christoffel symbols. No, that's not some weird--hey, where are you going?"

I then moved to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, advised by [Demba Ba](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/demba-ba) within the [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/). My research in Allston ~~sits~~ sat at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence--namely, how we can inform computer vision tasks with inspiration from the primary visual cortex. Of course, we do this with deep learning (who isn't?). See my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for more details. 

*UPDATE*
========
I am now at Columbia's Statistics department working on my PhD as of summer 2023. I have added reflections on my time at Harvard in the essays section. Thanks to all of the folks who made my time in Boston enjoyable (or at least bearable), especially: my mom and dad; my grandfather who passed just before graduation but was able to celebrate in the Columbia move; IACS peers and friends, especially Bill Zhai and Emilia Mazzolenis; members of the CRISP lab and Shubham Choudhary, who will soon be kicked out for his numerous crimes; the OG DURM Squad including Fat Kat Richard, "De Nang" Dale David Stewart, and Jimbo Jambs; that one homeless guy who said I looked "like a smart dude"; Matt Damon for calling me "Tiny Tim" at the Good Will Hunting Bench; the amazing Maria Stavros Shevory for being the best physical therapist on the planet; Albano for the sweet fades at the barbershop. 

Personal
=========

I enjoy much more than just math or AI or programming. Above all else, I enjoy writing. Essays, poems, screenplays, whatever--experimenting with form is itself one of the joys of writing. Life is about balance, and mathematical thinking would be weak without clear writing skills (and vice versa). There are several forms of truth (literary truth, scientific truth, visual truth, etc.), and of these formats, the screenplay most amazes me in its ability to incorporate all of these different mediums into one product. 

Feel free to read my essays. Or don't. And please feel free to reach out.
