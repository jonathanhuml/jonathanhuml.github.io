Thanks for visiting my personal site!

Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I studied Mathematics (B.A.) and Statistics (B.S.) just down the road at UNC-Chapel Hill. I began research in the field of computer vision during my last year and a half of undergrad and I've been working in the field of AI ever since, especially after the recruiters said it would make me money. 

In 2021, I moved to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. 

My research in Allston blended natural and artificial intelligence, informing computer vision tasks with inspiration from the primary visual cortex. See my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for more details. Thank you to the wonderful [CRISP group](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/) for an enlightening and productive two years. 

As of 2024, I am pursuing my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University. 

In my free time, I like shooting the breeze, going prematurely deaf just bopping in the stu, playing chess, pursuing inner peace, and being a sexually dedicated husband.

There the posts on this site, but I have begun to transfer these posts to [jonhumlatnight.com](http://www.jonhumlatnight.com/). You can always ask me about graduate admissions or PhD life over LinkedIn/email/etc. but you will find an FAQ on exactly this subject over there. I'm hoping to document more of my experience in New York on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhuml), and I maintain a [Substack](substack.com/@jonhuml) as well.

*UPDATE (6/24):* I am back in Upper West Side, and I brought THE WOO back with me.


*UPDATE (9/23):* I have actually deferred my enrollment at Columbia until next Fall. However, I will be continuing research with [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) in the meantime. Please continue to reach out for collaborations, academic or non-academic, until I come back to New York next summer!

*UPDATE (6/23):* I moved to Columbia's Statistics department to work on my PhD. I have added reflections on my time at Harvard in the essays section. Thanks to all of the folks who made my time in Boston possible, especially: my mom and dad, as well as my grandpa Wile; IACS peers and friends, especially [Bill Zhai](https://billyzz.github.io/), Emilia Mazzolenis, and [Albert Ge](https://www.albertge.com/); members of the CRISP lab and Shubham Choudhary, who will soon be kicked out for his heinous criminal activity; the OG DURM Squad including Fat Kat Richard, "Da Nang" Dale David, and Jimbo Jambs; Matt Damon for calling me "Tiny Tim" at the Good Will Hunting Bench; the amazing Maria Stavros Shevory for being the best physical therapist on the planet.
